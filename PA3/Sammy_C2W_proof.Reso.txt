Basically using the ~C2W, prove the C2W and they will be contradiction and will prove it!


1.  ~C2W                   To prove
2.  ~O1Y or (C1Y or C1B)   By Implication Elimination (IE)
3.  ~L1W or ~C1W           By Implication Elimination (IE)
4.  ~O2W or (C2W or C2B)   By Implication Elimination (IE)
5.  ~L2Y or ~C2Y           By Implication Elimination (IE)
6.  ~O3Y or (C3Y or C3B)   By Implication Elimination (IE)
7.  ~L3B or ~C3B           By Implication Elimination (IE)
8.  O1Y                    By Reversing the IE (Initial Symbols)
9.  L1W                    By Reversing the IE (Initial Symbols)
10. O2W                    By Reversing the IE (Initial Symbols)
11. L2Y                    By Reversing the IE (Initial Symbols)
12. O3Y                    By Reversing the IE (Initial Symbols)
13. L3B                    By Reversing the IE (Initial Symbols)
14. C1Y or C1B             By Resolution on 2 and 8
15. C2W or C2B             By Resolution on 4 and 10
16. C3Y or C3B             By Resolution on 6 and 12
17. ~C3B                   By Resolution on 7 and 13
18. C3B or C3Y             By Commutative on 16
19. C3Y                    By Resolution on 17 and 18
20. ~C1Y                   By Resolution on 19 and (~C1B or ~C2B)
21. C1B                    By Resolution on 14 and 20
22. ~C2B                   By Resolution on 21 and (~C1B or ~C2B)
23. C2B or C2W             By Commutative on 16
24. C2W                    By Resolution on 22 and 23
25. Ã˜                      Becayse of 1 and 24
